I just tasted something that is pink and sour like lemons!
I just tasted something that is orange and bitter like balsamic vinegar!
I just tasted something that is Yellow and tart like cholula taco sauce!
I just tasted something that is Chartreuse and tangy like mustard!
I just tasted something that is Green and acrid like olive oil!
I just tasted something the is midnight blue and creamy like milk!
